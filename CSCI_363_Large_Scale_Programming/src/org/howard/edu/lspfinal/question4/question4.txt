One instance where using a design pattern may not be beneficial is when it leads to 
overcomplicating the design for a problem that has a simple solution. As discussed in 
lecture (see Slide 4 of "An Introduction to Design Patterns"), while patterns promote 
flexibility and reuse, this can come at the cost of increased complexity in the system's 
architecture.

For example, applying a design pattern like Strategy or Template Method in a case where 
behavior is unlikely to change might unnecessarily increase the number of classes and 
interfaces in the system. This violates the KISS principle ("Keep It Simple, Stupid") 
that was emphasized in class and could lead to reduced clarity and maintainability of 
the code.

Thus, using a pattern just for the sake of using one, instead of solving a recurring 
design issue, contradicts the practical and contextual nature that design patterns are 
meant to embody. Patterns are tools—not mandates—and forcing them into simple problems 
may hurt more than help.
